"""Graph Memory MCP tools package.

Importing this package registers all 27 tools on the shared ``mcp``
FastMCP instance defined in :mod:`._core`.  Each sub-module groups
related tools by domain.

Re-exports the ``mcp`` instance and key helpers so that ``server.py``
and tests can import them from a single location.
